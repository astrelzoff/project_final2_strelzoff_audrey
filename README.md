## 3. Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this assignment and the list in the syllabus.

## 4. Comments
* I saw that the normalize.css throws a bunch of warnings. I actually do not like using this code and if it is not required, I would like permission to simply apply the reset rule and the code to make unrecognized html5 elements display block.
